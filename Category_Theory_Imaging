We present a mathematically and methodologically consistent framework for modeling imaging processes in complex physical and biological systems, rooted in the formal language of category theory and inspired by Leibniz’s metaphysical insights articulated in *Monadology*. This approach enables the structured integration of advanced mathematical abstractions and physical theories into imaging pipelines in a composable and interpretable manner. The formalism naturally lends itself to implementation via modern functional programming environments—including Haskell, functional Python, and JAX—facilitating direct deployment in AI-based imaging workflows. As a result, the framework not only provides a principled foundation for image analysis but also supports systematic cataloguing of algorithms and serves as a valuable tool for education, enabling deeper transparency and reproducibility across computational imaging science.
